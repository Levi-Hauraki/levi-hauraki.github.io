          <h2>My Learning</h2>
           <p>My learning strategy was basically following along with the sections one at a time
            and work on what I could then and their. If I needed something to go over I'd reread the 
            question and look for possible solutions in what was given. A problem I found was going 
            to indepth or finding different solutions for the same issue and then getting lost or 
            getting distracted by something and not focusing on my work I also find it easier to learn 
            watching short videos or looking at examples of what were learning.</p>
            
            <p>I enjoyed when I finally completed each part, when I got to see that what I did actually 
            worked and got to see that though I felt confused that I was doing it. I was on the right 
            path or at least knew what I was trying to do. Though I tend to get distracted and a long term
            plan really is to just graduate and go from their I'm not sure about what career I want after 
            just that I'm still looking into it.</p>

            <p>I've written different schedules for when I'm feeling high energy and low energy so I 
            have times for when I study and rest and depending on the mood with scheduled breaks. A skill 
            I would like to better is my communication skills as I have issues with speaking at times
            and having a time limit at how long I can be stuck on a issue before I seek help.
          
            </p>
