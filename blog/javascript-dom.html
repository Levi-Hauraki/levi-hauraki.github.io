          <h2>Did you know</h2>
                  <p>Javascript, HTML, and CSS work together to make a website work. HTML is the structure, 
                    CSS is the design and Javascript is the function of how things work. A HTML file contains 
                    the structure of the page itself. It is kind of like the structure of the building.
                    A CSS file contains the styling of the page. It allows you to change colors, positioning 
                    and more. It is kind of like the design of the building itself.
                    A JavaScript file determines the dynamic and interactive elements on the page. It 
                    determines what happens when users click, hover or type within certain elements. This is
                     kind of like the functionality of the building.. </p>
                    
                 <p>Control flow and loops, arrays and objects 
                    *The control flow is the order the computer does statements in a script. Code is run in 
                    order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across 
                    structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. Another way to look at 
                    it is that a control flow is similiar to a schedule you keep you usually order it for what you need 
                    to do first to last and you would complete each task in order and you would only stop if something 
                    intervered.</p>
                    
                    <p>*Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a conditionn in simple terms 
                    loops are repeatative task so like building blocks over and over again or how you need to prepare
                    food everyday its a loop unless something pops up to interrupt but once thatts finished
                    you would go back to the task at hand. Conditions usually are  true or false when analysed. A loop 
                    will continue running until the main condition returns false. JavaScript for a loop blocks 
                    code as long as a specified condition is true. JavaScript for loops take three arguments: initialization, 
                    condition, and increment. The condition expression is looked over on every loop. A loop continues to 
                    run if the expression returns true.</p>
                    
                    <p>*In JavaScript, an array is a single variable that is used to store different elements. 
                    Unlike in other languages where an array is a reference to the multiple variables, in a 
                    JavaScript array it is a single variable that stores multiple elements kind of like a bag 
                    for elements in javascript the array stores elements inside it while in JavaScript, an object 
                    is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A 
                    cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way,
                    JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.</p>
                    
                  <P>Functions and why they are useful
                    A function allows you to define a block of code, give it a name and then use it 
                    as many times as you want. A function can include one or more parameters and
                    they are a good alternative to having repeating code in a programs and
                    also increase the reusability of a code plus values can be passed to a function using
                    variables â€“ which we call parameters or arguments and Functions can also return values.
                    functions are like reusable cups in some ways it purpose is defined you can use it 
                    in different scenarios saves you from using plastic cups which is why functions are useful </P>
                      
                   <P>The DOM and DevTool
                        The Document Object Model or DOM is a programming interface for web documents. It 
                        represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and 
                        content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming 
                        languages can interact with the page.
                        Developer tools or DevTools are programs that allow a developer to create, test and 
                        debug software. ... They let users inspect and debug the page's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                        files and allow it to inspect the network traffic it causes, making it possible to 
                        measure its performance, and much more.</P>
