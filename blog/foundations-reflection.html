          <h4>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h4>
                  <p>Three new things I’ve learnt about myself are that I need to keep a timer to remember 
                    to take breaks, that I’m way more of a night owl then I thought and I’m easily distracted.
                     </p>
                    
                     <h4>What are the roles of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
                  <p>They are all very Important in learning and programming. Values, empathy and self awareness dictate 
                    how you learn and how you treat those you interact as values and empathy can coincide with your 
                    learning style and self awareness is just how aware you are of yourself they all work together in 
                    everyday life but also in how you learn. </p>

                      <h4>What has surprised you the most about core learning? </h4>
                  <P>Neuroplasticity and mindset growth is the core lesson that surprised me the most as I didn’t really
                     know anything about them and found them the most interesting as they taught more about that anyone can 
                     learn anything as long as they put the work in which I've always thought so that was interesting 
                     to learn about. </P>

                    <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
                      <p> I didn’t find the core all that challenging. It was more learning something then reflecting how 
                        you understand it which was very interesting. I didn't find all that challenging and then added 
                        in explaining to others when we got to looping.</p>

                    <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning 
                      in a web development bootcamp course?  </h4>
                    <p>Because core skills are important no matter the field and it doesn’t matter if you're the best in your
                       field if you can’t work or talk to someone and in programming you do need to communicate with people.</p>

                    <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? 
                      Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.  </h4>
                        <p>No it's not a waste. It does feel important to learn as well as offer us a break from coding.
                           It's a great way to insert a little break from practice as well as teaching us more about ourselves 
                           and how to look more critically at ourselves so that we can understand our own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
