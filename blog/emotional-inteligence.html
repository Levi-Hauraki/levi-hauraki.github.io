          <h2>Emotional Inteligence</h2>
                  <p>Emotional Intelligence Is your ability to understand, control, and know your emotions as 
                    well as understand others emotions and how to use it to better your relationships and
                    and understanding of others. Emotional Intelligence  is defined as a person's ability to 
                    identify, evaluate, control, and express emotions. People with high EQ usually make great 
                    leaders and team players because of their ability to understand, empathize, and connect 
                    with the people around them. </p>
                    
                 <p>How IQ differs from EQ is that IQ is more about intelligence, problem solving, book smarts
                    and the like while EQ focuses more on how you feel and more about how you feel and 
                    understanding emotions in yourself and others.</p>

                  <P>EQ is important in nearly every way: it's the understanding of how you process 
                    and evaluate emotions as well as how you relate and understand others. You use EQ in everyday
                    life when you interact with others, starting conversations, or when you're processing hard
                    emotions and need to deal with them in a healthy way.</P>
