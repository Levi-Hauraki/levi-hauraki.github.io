          <h2>My Approach</h2>
                  <p>A really easy issue I ran into was with Dom-applying-classes and Dom-interaction. 
                    The issues I had was a simple case of not understanding the instructions properly as well 
                    as just plain simple spelling mistakes but the way I went about trying to solve it I do find 
                    quite amusing.</p>
                    
                 <p>Let's start off with Dom-Interactions which is what I did first. My approach when learning
                    is first to go over it and see what I understand, then try to find a solution on google and
                     youtube to find a live example. Then moving on to trying to see if it works then try what 
                     I now know is the rubber duck method and if that fails  checking slack and then asking for 
                     help. I went through this at least twice because everything should have been working. From 
                     what I can tell everyone was having an issue with the count on screen and so I asked our 
                     facilitator Leilani for help and we went over the issue which ended up being I was missing “Quotation marks” 
                     around (invisible) instead of looking like  
                     evt.target.classList.toggle(“invisible”)
                     They looked like this and I didn’t notice for four days
                     evt.target.classList.toggle(invisible)
                     This was on every line where invisible was in brackets.
                    </p>

                  <P>I experienced the same issues with the Dom-applying classes  except it was
                     literally the first command I had issues with  which wasn’t even really a 
                     command 
                     Uncomment line 8 of `classes.js`.
                     Somehow my mind translated this to mean delete the whole line  //one and 
                     then trying it as I was expecting something to happen. I basically did what I
                     had stated previously before contacting  Leilani who then pointed it out to me. 
                     From their it was smooth sailing and I completed it fairly quickly but still I 
                     find it amusing it was just one small slip up that caused all that frustration 
                     and during this entire experience I felt utter confusion about why it didn’t work
                      as well as stress about trying to understand what was wrong though mainly 
                      confusion and what I learned from all this was have patience though also that I 
                      am most likely going to have to go over this repeatedly for spelling mistakes 
                      anytime I’m doing Javascript as well as read instructions carefully as well as
                      take your time.
                    </P>
