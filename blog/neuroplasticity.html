          <h3>How does understanding the principles of Neuroplasticity benefit People</h3>
                  <p>Neuroplasticity  allows your brain to adapt and change, which helps promote: 
                     The ability to learn new things. The ability to enhance your existing cognitive capabilities. 
                     Recovery from strokes and traumatic brain injuries and the significance of 
                     neuroplasticity Neuroplasticity is incredibly important because it is at the root of 
                     essential human experiences. Learning and memory, key parts of what it means to be human,
                     would not be possible without this process
                     </p>
                    
                     <H3>How does engaging in the principles of neuroplasticity benefit you</H3>
                  <p>The benefits of neuroplasticity are the ability to learn new things.The ability to enhance your 
                      existing cognitive capabilities. Recovery from strokes and traumatic brain injuries. 
                      Strengthening areas if some functions are lost or decline. Improvements that can promote 
                      brain fitness. Basically Neuroplasticity helps you in everyday life and whenever you need 
                      to do anything to better yourself </p>

                      <H3>What can you do to increase your Neuroplasticity </H3>
                  <P>One way is video games which can give better benefits such as motor skills, visual recognition, memory
                     and reaction times, reasoning and problem-solving skills, resilience, cooperation and team 
                     participation. In short, when you play video games, you teach your brain new skills. These 
                     effects can improve your gameplay, but they also carry over to the rest of your life so if you 
                     enjoy playing video games they are really helpful and different games lead to different effects.
                     Learning a new language can help with language, attention, motor skills, memory and emotions and other things.
                     Music can also be a huge help. It can improve your mood, ability to learn, concentration and focus. Other 
                     things that can help are Exercise, travel, drawing/Art and these can all be used to increase your 
                     Neuroplasticity. 
                    </P>  

                    <h3>Affects my Learning Plan</h3>
                      <p>What I’ve learned from this and how it affects my Learning plan is interesting as I 
                         actually already use a few of these methods when studying. I listen to music to help with 
                         my mood and focus asI have a playlist dedicated to studying and play video games in my down
                         time when I’m not reading and I draw when watching long youtube videos to help me focus 
                         so finding out these actually help with my learning is really nice and when looking into 
                         a growth mindset I found that it was interesting as it encouraged a more positive approach 
                         to learning. Something that anyone can do as long as they put the effort in and I found 
                         that interesting as long as they think along the lines of not yet instead of you can’t 
                         or you failed anyone should be able to succeed in what they are focused on which is honestly 
                         something I do believe in.
