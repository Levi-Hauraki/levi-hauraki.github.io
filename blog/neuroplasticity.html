          <h3>How does understanding the principles of Neuroplasticity benefit People</h3>
                  <p>Neuroplasticity  allows your brain to adapt and change, which helps promote: 
                     The ability to learn new things. The ability to enhance your existing cognitive capabilities. 
                     Recovery from strokes and traumatic brain injuries and the significance of 
                     neuroplasticity Neuroplasticity is incredibly important because it is at the root of 
                     essential human experiences. Learning and memory, key parts of what it means to be human,
                     would not be possible without this process
                     </p>
                    
                     <H3>How does engaging in the principles of neuroplasticity benefit you</H3>
                  <p>The benefits of neuroplasticity are the ability to learn new things.The ability to enhance your 
                      existing cognitive capabilities. Recovery from strokes and traumatic brain injuries. 
                      Strengthening areas if some functions are lost or decline. Improvements that can promote 
                      brain fitness. Basically Neuroplasticity helps you in everyday life and whenever you need 
                      to do anything to better yourself </p>

                      <H3>What can you do to increase your Neuroplasticity </H3>
                  <P>One way is video games which can give better benefits such as motor skills, visual recognition, memory
                     and reaction times, reasoning and problem-solving skills, resilience, cooperation and team 
                     participation. In short, when you play video games, you teach your brain new skills. These 
                     effects can improve your gameplay, but they also carry over to the rest of your life so if you 
                     enjoy playing video games they are really helpful and different games lead to different effects.
                     Learning a new language can help with language, attention, motor skills, memory and emotions and other things.
                     Music can also be a huge help. It can improve your mood, ability to learn, concentration and focus. Other 
                     things that can help are Exercise, travel, drawing/Art and these can all be used to increase your 
                     Neuroplasticity. 
                    </P>
